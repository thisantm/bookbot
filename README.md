# BookBot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot is a simple Python project that reads a text file, counts the words and letters, and generates a report.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/thisantm/bookbot.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd bookbot
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that performs the text analysis and generates the report.
- `books/`: Directory containing the text files to be analyzed.
